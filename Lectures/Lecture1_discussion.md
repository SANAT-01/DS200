__Explain the five Vs of Big Data?__

* Volume: The volume of data that companies manage skyrocketed around 2012, when they began collecting more and more data everyday. This grows exponentially, doubling every few years or even months in some cases.

* Velocity: In addition to managing data, companies need that information to flow quickly – as close to real-time as possible. “Velocity can be more important than volume because it can give us a bigger competitive advantage. Sometimes it’s better to have limited data in real time than lots of data at a low speed.” The data have to be available at the right time to make appropriate business decisions. Few hours later, this information is not nearly as important.

* Variety: Diversity. A company can obtain data from many different sources: from in-house devices to smartphone GPS technology or what people are saying on social networks. The importance of these sources of information varies depending on the nature of the business. For example, a mass-market service or product should be more aware of social networks than an industrial business.

* Veracity: In this context is equivalent to quality. We have all the data, but could we be missing something? Are the data “clean” and accurate? Do they really have something to offer?

* Value: Finally, the V for value sits at the top of the big data pyramid. This refers to the ability to transform a tsunami of data into business.
